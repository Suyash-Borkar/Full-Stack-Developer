                    Bhagwan Ganpati, or Ganesha, is one of the most worshipped deities in India. The state of Maharashtra is renowned for its sacred Ashtavinayak temples, which hold special significance for devotees. The term "Ashtavinayak" is derived from Sanskrit, meaning "Eight Ganeshas." These eight temples are located in different areas, and all of them are considered Swayambhu, or self-originated. These deities are described as Jagrut, meaning they fulfill the wishes of their devotees. 
                    The Ashtavinayaka Yatra is a pilgrimage covering these eight holy abodes of Ganesha, primarily situated in and around Pune and Raigad districts of Maharashtra. Among the eight temples, five are in Pune, two in Raigad, and one in Ahmednagar (Ahilya Nagar) district. Ganesha is worshipped first before any other deity in Hindu rituals. 
                    The pilgrimage typically takes three days to complete, beginning at the Morgaon temple and covering the following sequence:
